## Welcome to Back Pain Monitor Project Website

### Vision

Back pain is a problem for many people and it’s hard to record that pain. It is one of the most common injuries that is highly reoccurring & cannot easily be treated. If it’s not treated correctly, the pain can become chronic and even disabling. Due to the nature of back pain’s random occurrences, someone might have trouble keeping track of their pain for their own records and for communicating with their physician. These records of pain can be very useful to the doctor who can then analyze them and spot patterns that could lead to a more serious injury.

For the first semester, we have focussed on enabling the user to report their pain quickly and in a detailed manner. We focussed on allowing the user to not only see these records but to see insights and patterns that come with these occurrences such as the frequency in certain areas, intensity, and what makes the pain worse. Additionally, we focused on allowing the user to now enter any medication they are using, and track the pain at each use. Through this first semester, we were able to provide an application where a user can record their pain completely and see insights into their records, along with being able to filter through dates. We accomplished all our goals for the year in enabling a user to record their pain quickly and be given insights that will help stop further injury. 

For the upcoming semester, we plan to implement the back end of the app which will allow for more security and to keep records stored after the app is closed. In addition, we will look to implement a way to export these reports based on the information from the logs and insights, so they can be more easily shared with the user’s physician. We are also planning on expanding medication use by giving the user a way to see all their doses and the effect they are having on the pain. 


### Team

Catherine DeJager - A 5th-year senior majoring in computer science (BCS) and minoring in Mathematics, Data Science, and Linguistics. Interested in software engineering and passionate about clear communication and good user experience.

SeongIl(Leo) Kim - A 4th-year senior majoring in computer science (BCS). I always had interest in web/app development and this is the great opportunity to explore things I haven't done before.

Mitchell Niesar - A 4th-year senior majoring in computer science (BCS). I am very interested in exploring a career in cybersecurity and I enjoy making applications for jobs that I work at. For example I developed an application for a cleaning company that tracks progress at their job sites and keeps a database of before and after pictures. 

### App Deployment

Android Installation:
Start by running an npm install to make sure all libraries are installed. Then type “ionic cap copy” which will perform an ionic build and then copy the web assets to the capacitor native platform(s). Ionic cap update then makes sure all dependencies are accounted for. Finally type”ionic cap open android” which will open Android Studio and open your selected device, or in this case your phone.


IOS  Installation:

Start by running an npm install to make sure all libraries are installed. Then type “npm run ios” which will perform an ionic build and then copy the web assets to the capacitor native platform(s), make sure all dependencies are accounted for, and then open Xcode and open your selected device, or in this case your phone.
