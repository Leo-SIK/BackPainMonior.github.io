Intro

### Vision

Back pain is a problem for many people and it’s hard to record back pain. Back pain is one of the most common injuries that is highly reoccurring and cannot easily be treated. If not treated correctly, the pain can become chronic and even disabling. Due to the nature of back pain’s random occurrences, someone might have trouble keeping track of their pain for their own records and for communicating with their doctor so that the person can describe what is happening and the doctor can provide adequate treatment. The record of pain can be highly useful to the doctor who can analyze the records and help you treat the pain.
