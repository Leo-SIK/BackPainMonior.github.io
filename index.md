Intro

### Vision

Back pain is a problem for many people and it’s hard to record back pain. Back pain is one of the most common injuries that is highly reoccurring and cannot easily be treated. If not treated correctly, the pain can become chronic and even disabling. Due to the nature of back pain’s random occurrences, someone might have trouble keeping track of their pain for their own records and for communicating with their doctor so that the person can describe what is happening and the doctor can provide adequate treatment. The record of pain can be highly useful to the doctor who can analyze the records and help you treat the pain.

#### Design Norm

Transparency is a design norm that “deals with open communication and providing clear and honest information”. We are providing doctors with a more transparent view of a patient’s medical history (since information may be communicated more clearly through regular reporting with an app than the patient trying to remember all the details when they’re in the doctor’s office). We have redflags symptoms (such as losing bladder control, numbness, losing weight which are critical symptoms require immediate help) so that patients know when their symptoms indicate that they need to get help sooner (e.g., by calling their doctor or going to the ER). This is an example of transparency in that patients are receiving important information. Another example of transparency is making the user interface more intuitive (e.g., using next and back buttons with arrows instead of with text).
